During my junior year, I learned the detailed design specification of software engineering.</p>
  <h4>Personal interest</h4>
 <p>My favorite subject is English. I have studied it for several years. I like it because it is very interesting.
I think English is very useful. I can learn some western culture by learning English. 
My favorite subject is mathematics.It's really interesting, and sometimes it's hard to understand, because some math problems are difficult, but I like math very much, so I like math best.But I prefer geography, because I like traveling so much and enjoy all kinds of spectacular scenery.
  I like basketball, which is my favorite sport, and I like to study all kinds of weird things. Games are also one of my hobbies. Playing games makes me feel relaxed and happy.</p> 
  <h4>Personal strengths and weaknesses</h4>
  <p>Advantages: I am a calm person, I will be very rational to look at the problem, optimistic and positive, really decided to do something, will definitely do it well, no matter how difficult the process, good at communication, good at learning
Disadvantages: Occasionally hesitate, sometimes overconfident, sometimes too much pressure on yourself, eager to achieve, too late.Identify your weaknesses, list the things with unsatisfactory results in your life, summarize the commonalities of these things, ask for feedback, redefine your weaknesses, strive to strengthen your weaknesses, formulate a general action plan, and use your strengths to build confidence. For example, if you are afraid of math but are good at computers, you can fill all the data into a spreadsheet and let it do mathematical calculations for you to solve budget related tasks.</p>
